The main use of these scripts is for me (Buckminsterfullerene) to load into my BP Asset Generator tool.
- BP_names_and_locations - This script stores the type, name and relative path of all BP assets into the JSON file.
- gen_BP_object_info - This script generates the name, inheritance, property and functions information from all the BP files from the Guttir C++ header dumper, into the JSON file.
