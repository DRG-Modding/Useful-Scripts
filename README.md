# Useful-Scripts
 A place to put any useful little scripts you would like to share here.
 
 If you would like to contribute, and are not a member of the organisation, please contact me (Buckminsterfullerene#6666) on Discord so I can send you an invite.
 
 If you are a member of the org, please make a folder to categorise what your script does and add a readme inside that explains how to use it/them (if not already inside the scripts).
